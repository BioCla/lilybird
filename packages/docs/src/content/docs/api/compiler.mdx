The compiler in lilybird is what makes our api possible, it builds all the listeners **once** at startup so you only get both, what you defined and with proper transformers (if present) without any runtime checks after the bot starts.

The lack of this extra checks on every event is what makes lilybird so fast, the workflow is just<br/> `event -> listener` with the only thing possibly in the middle being the transformers you define or in some cases the cache code.
